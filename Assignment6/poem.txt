goose and moose.
it is hard to tell just what a goose.
will have in common with a moose.
or better yet,just what three geese
will have in common with three meese.
i will say this once i will say this thrice
the plural for moose is mice,
or plural for three mice is messes.
i think that i may fall to pieces.
i feel my dizzy state increase
about the mice,the grice and geese.
